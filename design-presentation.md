# Design Process
1. Searching for other similar types of studies 
2. Where to find the neccessary sensor and simulation eguipment plus software
3. Preliminary specs from TA
4. Decision about sensors and simulators
We have found out from the specs of DJI Inspire 1 information

# Previous research
[FOODsniffer](http://www.myfoodsniffer.com) electronic nose for checking if food is safe and fresh to eat.

[Sensor drone for aerial odor mapping for agriculture and security services](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7561340/?reload=true) Similar project to what we are making

[The eNose company](http://www.enose.nl/) Company that is specialiced in making portable and lightweight sensor applications.

[Air quality monitor using arduino](https://plot.ly/arduino/air-quality-tutorial/)

# Scenario & Use cases
* Scenario
	* Detecting and locating forest fires from the air
	* Drone can be easily deployed on site and start automatic search for a possible fire
	* Drone has live video feed from which the operator on the ground can verify that fire is starting or going.
* Possible use case
	* Drone and sensor are activated on the ground and Drone starts automatic search procedure
	* Drone finds a potential fire and starts to fly to it
	* Operator on the ground verifies drones findings using onboard camera and live video.

# System design

* 4 base components
    * Drone
	* Android device
	* Remote control device
	* Sensor array
* Sensor has a data processor, material sent to android application
* Android application interacts with drone control software and gives it commands
